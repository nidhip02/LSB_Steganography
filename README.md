# LSB_Steganography
Project encodes a message in an image and decodes the image to display message. Uses python libraries PIL and Tkinter 

Image steganography is one of the most discreet methods of cryptography. It allows copyright and watermarking and helps in maintaining privacy 
and security of sensitive information to be communicated.

The program communicates secret data. It encodes the message into the least significant bits of the RGB values of each pixel in the image "img.jpg" 
and creates a new image "new.jpg". Both these images are same to the naked eye and no difference can be detected by humans.
This message is further decoded from "new.jpg" and displayed.

This was done using Python with the help of the following libraries: PIL/pillow and Tkinter.
